## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents data and evaluations as required by the groundwater protection programs for the {{facility}} facility (“the Facility”) for the {{reporting_period}} reporting period (“reporting period”). This {{reporting_quarter}} Groundwater Protection Monitoring Report is being submitted in fulfillment of Permit Condition VII.D.2 of the State Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) part B permit. The latest Facility Permit was renewed {{permit_renewal}}.

During the fourth quarter 2020, field activities included the inspection of monitoring wells, measurement of leachate levels, measurement of well depth and if present, depth to groundwater in all monitoring wells, and collection of leachate and groundwater samples. RAD parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit including Radium 226, Radium 228, field-filtered Uranium (Dissolved), Uranium (Total), Gross Alpha, and Gross Beta are analyzed quarterly from the Closed Secure Cell LCS, Active Secure Cell LCS, Secure Cell LDS, and TRB LDS on a quarterly basis. Sufficient fluid for analysis was available from Cell 1-LCS/LDS, Cell 2-LCS, Cell 4-LCS/LDS, and TRB-LDS. Samples collected from Active Secure Cell 4-LCS were analyzed for the organic and inorganic parameters listed in 6 CCR 1007-3, 268.40 for Waste Code F039.

Additionally, leachate samples were collected from Active Secure Cell 4-LDS and analyzed for perfluorooctonate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) constituents. Leachate samples collected from the Secure Cell LDS (Cell 1 LDS and Cell 4 LDS) and TRB LDS were analyzed for the organic and inorganic parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit including VOCs, SVOCs, PCBs, Chlorinated Herbicides, Organochlorine Pesticides, Metals, General Chemistry Parameters, Cyanide, Nitrate/Nitrite, Total Organic Carbon, Total Dissolved Solids, Alkalinity, and Fluoride. A summary listing of the analytical suites for the fourth quarter 2020 groundwater sampling event for each sampling location is provided in Table 2: 2020 Second Semi Annual Monitoring Analytical Summary.

Groundwater samples were collected from twenty-four (24) monitoring wells classified with suitable groundwater yield during the first quarter of 2020. These monitoring wells are listed in Table 2: 2020 Second Semi-Annual Monitoring Analytical Summary. Samples collected during the second semi-annual sampling event were analyzed for the organic and inorganic parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit. Table VII-3 includes organic and inorganic parameters including VOCs, SVOCs, PCBs, Chlorinated Herbicides, Organochlorine Pesticides, Metals, General Chemistry Parameters, Cyanide, Nitrate/Nitrite, Total Organic Carbon, Total Dissolved Solids, Alkalinity, and Fluoride. These wells were also sampled and analyzed for the RAD parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit including Radium 226, Radium 228, field-filtered Uranium (Dissolved), Uranium (Total), Gross Alpha, and Gross Beta, which are all measured on a quarterly basis.

Groundwater and leachate samples were collected November 7 through 12, 2020. Clean Harbors personnel collected all RCRA and RAD samples following the procedures specified in Permit Attachment 8 Groundwater Sampling Plan. RAD samples were analyzed by Test America of Earth City, Missouri using procedures specified in Part VII of the Permit and the Sampling Plan. RCRA samples including PFOA and PFOS were analyzed by SGS Wheatridge, Colorado.

Fluid levels collected weekly from Cell1-LCS, Cell2-LCS, Cell3-LCS, and Cell4-LCS remained relatively constant for the fourth quarter of 2020. Hydraulic communication between the LCS and the Leak Detection System (LDS) or Permanent Sumps (PS) was not indicated based on the observed fluid levels. Groundwater levels were analyzed in accordance with Section VII.C.1.a. of the Deer Trail Permit Part VII. Groundwater levels were within the anticipated ranges.

There were forty-six (46) organic detections in the leachate samples collected from Secure Cell1- LDS, Cell4-LCS/LDS, and TRB-LDS. Secure Cell1-LCS and Secure Cell2-LCS were not required to be sampled for organics during the fourth quarter. Twenty-three (23) volatile organic compounds; twelve (12) semi-volatile organic compounds; and eleven (11) herbicide and pesticide constituents were detected. PCB Aroclors were not detected in any leachate sample collected. There were three (3) organic detections above the RL in three (3) of the twenty-four (24) groundwater wells sampled. These constituents include Acetone, bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate, and Phenol. All three (3) constituents are common analytical laboratory contaminants. Table F-1: Summary of Accepted Laboratory Analysis Data presents the organic compounds detected in the leachate samples collected.

The radiological (RAD) samples collected during the fourth quarter of 2020 consisted of the RAD parameters as referenced in Table VII-3 of the Permit. These constituents included Gross Alpha, Gross Beta, Uranium (Total), Radium 226, and Radium 228. Field-filtered Uranium (Dissolved) was also collected. RAD constituents were detected in all six (6) leachate samples collected; all six (6) constituents were detected at least once. RAD constituents were detected in all twenty-four (24) monitoring wells sampled; all six (6) constituents were detected at least once.

Data validation was performed on all samples in accordance with Permit Condition VII.C.2. The data validation procedures were developed to evaluate the data in terms of accuracy, precision, and completeness. Field duplicate precision is determined by calculating the relative percent difference (RPD) between the sample and field duplicate sample. The field duplicate RPD criterion is 30 percent as specified in the Deer Trail Groundwater Sampling Plan. Analytical precision cannot be determined if the reported concentration is below the RL. Forty-two (42) primary sample and duplicate pairs representing four (4) of the 5 duplicates and thirty-five (35) constituents are included in the list of exceptions. The constituents noted include organics (15), metals (9), PFOS/PFOA (6), radionuclides (3), general chemistry parameters (1), and Nitrate-Nitrite (1). The discrepancy in fifteen (15) of the samples is due to a comparison of a reported value against a non-detect, a J value, or a U-value. J-Values Result is less than the Reporting Limit but greater than or equal to the Method Detection Limit and the concentration is an approximate value. U-values indicate a result that is less than the sample detection limit.

All analytical data reported for the second semi-annual (fourth quarter) 2020 sampling events at the Deer Trail Facility are determined to be quantitative, with the exceptions noted, and are suitable for use in the background database. Completeness for all analytes and methods in the fourth quarter 2020 Deer Trail investigation is acceptable. A summary of the QA/QC results for the fourth quarter 2020 sampling event is presented in G-3: Data Validation Summary found in Appendix G.

In summary, the second semi-annual groundwater protection monitoring data does not present any indications of a verifiable waste release to groundwater from Facility operations.

## INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of the 2020 Second Semi-Annual (fourth quarterly) Groundwater Protection Monitoring Program for the Clean Harbors Deer Trail, LLC (the Facility) hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility located near Deer Trail, Colorado; EPA I.D. #: COD991300484. The Facility is located at 108555 East Highway 36 Deer Trail, CO 80105 as shown on Figure 1: Site Location Map. This report addresses the groundwater protection reporting requirements for the Facility’s three monitoring programs as described in the Facility’s current Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Part B Hazardous Waste Permit, Part VII: Groundwater Protection Program last renewed and approved in September 2019 and summarized below.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE MONITORING PROGRAM

The Facility groundwater protection program is described in Permit Part VII and related attachments. The program consists of three (3) monitoring programs:

- Secure Cell and Surface Impoundment Performance Monitoring Program
- Inspection Well Monitoring Program
- Detection Well Monitoring Program

The Secure Cell Performance Monitoring program monitors Closed Cell LCS, Active Cell LCS, and Secure Cell LDS and Permanent Sumps; this includes Cell 1-, Cell 2-, Cell 3-, and Cell 4-LCS/ LDS, and PS sampling. The Surface Impoundment Performance Monitoring Program consists of the Treatment Building (TRB) LDS sampling. The Detection and Inspection Monitoring Programs monitor Level 3, Level 4A, Level 4, Level 5, and Level 6 shallow geologic units. These wells are located inside, outside, and along the compliance boundary; see Figure 2: Monitoring Locations for Groundwater and Leachate. These distinct geologic units are described in detail, below, listed in order from shallow to deep units:

- Level 3 (L3) is defined as the discrete lenticular sand bodies that infrequently occur in the surficial Silty Clay Unit. Monitoring wells are installed at 50-foot intervals along the compliance boundary in those areas where the L3 is present. Water has not been detected in any L3 wells, with the exception of L3-42 in the northeastern area of the compliance boundary. The L3 wells are included in the Inspection Monitoring Program.
- Level 4A (L4A) is defined as the interface between the surficial Silty Clay Unit and the underlying weathered Pierre Shale. Monitoring wells are installed at 100-foot intervals in those areas where the L4A is (or historically was) saturated. The saturated conditions requiring L4A wells occur only along the northern compliance boundary near the former oil field brine pond. The L4A wells are included in the Detection Monitoring Program.
- Level 4 (L4) is defined as the interface between the weathered Pierre Shale and the underlying unweathered Pierre Shale. Monitoring wells are installed at 300-foot intervals along the compliance boundary except in those areas where L4 is (or historically was) saturated, where a closer well spacing (typically 100-foot intervals) is required. The saturated conditions requiring tighter spacing of the L4 wells occur only along portions of the northern compliance boundary and along the part of western compliance boundary. Several L4 wells are also installed on the western compliance boundary adjacent to Cells 1 and 2 and one L4 well (L4-9W) is installed outside the compliance boundary west of Cell 2\. The L4 wells are included in the Detection Monitoring Program.
- Level 5 (L5) represents the uppermost water-bearing unit at the Facility and is defined as the uppermost saturated portion of the unweathered Pierre Shale. There are eight L5 monitoring wells installed along the compliance boundary (Figure 2). The L5 wells are screened in silty partings that occur at varying depths in the unweathered Pierre Shale. The L5 wells are screened at depths of approximately 250 to 435 feet below ground surface. The L5 wells are included in the Detection Monitoring Program.
- Level 6 (L6) is defined as the first occurrence of saturated conditions in the alluvial drainages outside the compliance boundary but within the vicinity of the Facility. The wells are screened in the silty and fine sand units overlying weathered Pierre Shale and within the weathered Pierre Shale. The L6 wells are included in the Inspection Monitoring Program.

Table 1: 2020 Deer Trail Well Grouping shows the list of monitoring wells, by well number, that have been grouped together. The groupings were developed based on a comprehensive evaluation of hydrogeologic and water chemistry data. These groupings were presented in the Supplemental Background Data Evaluation Report, Revision No. 1, which was prepared by McCulley, Frick & Gilman, Inc. (MFG) and submitted to the CDPHE by the Facility on November 15, 1991.

The background groundwater quality database consists of monitoring data that have been collected on a quarterly and/or annual basis at the Facility since 1986. Groundwater quality data collected after the first acceptance of waste at the Facility (i.e., after the Third quarter 1991) are added to the background database in accordance with the Permit-specified procedures.

## METHODS

Prior to the collection of groundwater samples, Clean Harbors personnel inspected the Facility monitoring wells for organic vapors in the headspace, the condition of the wells, depth to water, and total depth. The well inspections were performed on November 7th, 2020. The results of the well inspection program can be found in Table 3: 2020 Second Semi-Annual Groundwater Elevation Summary and Appendix A: Field Classification Log, Groundwater Level Field Log, Monitoring Well and Non-Well Purge Sheets.

During the first quarter 2020, all groundwater monitoring wells were classified for groundwater yield in accordance with Permit Condition VII.B.6. The groundwater yield classification is used to determine the wells that will be sampled throughout 2020. Twenty-four (24) groundwater monitoring wells met the criteria for sampling during the evaluation.

Clean Harbors personnel performed sampling activities from November 7 through 12, 2020 following the procedures specified in the Permit Attachment 8, Groundwater Sampling Plan. Test America Laboratories (TA) of Earth City, MO, analyzed the samples for RAD and SGS Wheatridge performed the leachate and groundwater sample analyses the RCRA parameters including Waste Code F039, Table VII-3 and PFOA/PFOS. The laboratory reports are found within Appendix D: Laboratory Analytical Reports.

Groundwater samples were collected from twenty-four (24) groundwater monitoring wells and six (6) leachate ports (Cell1-LCS/LDS, Cell2-LCS, Cell4-LCS/LDS, and TRB-LDS). Cell2-LDS, Cell3-LCS/Cell3-LDS, and Cell1-PS, Cell2-PS, Cell3-PS and Cell 4-PS were dry and not sampled. Additionally, the water level in monitoring well L3-41 was below the screen and was not sampled. Figure 2 shows the locations of the monitoring wells that were sampled for the 2020 second semi annual sampling event.

### ANALYTICAL METHODS

The samples were analyzed utilizing the procedures specified in Permit Part VII: Groundwater Protection Program. Program details and requirements are also specified in Permit Attachment 8: Groundwater Sampling Plan. Sample analysis for the second semi-annual 2020 event is detailed below.

Leachate samples collected from Cell 1-LCS/LDS, Cell 2-LCS, Cell 4-LCS/LDS, and TRB-LDS were analyzed for various parameters depending on the unit monitored and the availability of sufficient samples for analysis. The frequency and analytes required by the Permit are summarized in Table A: 2020 Leachate and Groundwater Sampling Schedule, below.

RAD parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit including Radium 226, Radium 228, field filtered Uranium (Dissolved), Uranium (Total), Gross Alpha, and Gross Beta are analyzed quarterly from the Closed Secure Cell LCS, Active Secure Cell LCS, Secure Cell LDS, and TRB LDS on a quarterly basis. Sufficient fluid for analysis was available from Cell1-LCS/LDS, Cell2-LCS, Cell 4-LCS/LDS, and TRB-LDS. Samples collected from Active Secure Cell4-LCS were analyzed for the organic and inorganic parameters listed in 6 CCR 1007-3, 268.40 for Waste Code F039. Additionally, leachate samples were collected from Active Secure Cell4-LDS and analyzed for perfluorooctonate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) constituents. Leachate samples collected from the Secure Cell LDS (Cell1 LDS and Cell4 LDS) and TRB LDS were analyzed for the organic and inorganic parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit including VOCs, SVOCs, PCBs, Chlorinated Herbicides, Organochlorine Pesticides, Metals, General Chemistry Parameters, Cyanide, Nitrate/Nitrite, Total Organic Carbon, Total Dissolved Solids, Alkalinity, and Fluoride. A summary of the analytical suites for the third quarter 2020 groundwater sampling event for each sampling location is provided in Table 2: 2020 Second Semi-Annual Monitoring Analytical Summary.

Groundwater samples were collected from twenty-four (24) monitoring wells classified with suitable groundwater yield during the first quarter of 2020. These monitoring wells are listed in Table 2: 2020 Second Semi-Annual Monitoring Analytical Summary. Samples collected during the second semi-annual sampling event were analyzed for the organic and inorganic parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit. The table includes organic and inorganic parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit including VOCs, SVOCs, PCBs, Chlorinated Herbicides, Organochlorine Pesticides, Metals, General Chemistry Parameters, Cyanide, Nitrate/Nitrite, Total Organic Carbon, Total Dissolved Solids, Alkalinity, and Fluoride. These wells were also sampled and analyzed for the RAD parameters as listed in Table VII-3 of the Permit including Radium 226, Radium 228, field-filtered Uranium (Dissolved), Uranium (Total), Gross Alpha, and Gross Beta on a quarterly basis. The laboratory reports are found within Appendix D: Laboratory Analytical Reports.

## FLUID AND GROUNDWATER LEVEL MONITORING RESULTS

Fluid levels are measured from the Secure Cell Leachate Collection System (LCS), Secure Cell Leak Detection System (LDS) Permanent Sumps (PS), and Treatment Building (TRB)-LDS on a weekly basis by Deer Trail facility personnel. Groundwater levels are measured on a quarterly basis from all the monitoring wells. The third quarter 2020 groundwater elevation summary is presented in Table 3: 2020 Second Semi-Annual Groundwater Elevation Summary and Appendix B: Non Well Fluid Level Summary contains the non-well fluid level summaries for all fluid level measurements. The fluid level changes exhibited in the third quarter 2020 for each well and leachate collection, leak detection and permanent sump locations are summarized below. Historical groundwater level comparisons are evaluated in Appendix C: Hydrographs.

The groundwater and fluid level results for the Second Semi-Annual (fourth quarter) monitoring period 2020 do not show any indication of hydraulic communication between the LCS, LDS, and PS systems. The thirteen sumps for Cell1, Cell2, Cell3, Cell4, and the TRB are currently analyzed for fluid level exceedances based on the sump fluid level data. However, the sumps may be pumped daily and/or weekly as a part of normal Facility operations. Exceedance results from the sumps are not necessarily indicative of physical changes in the landfill cells or TRB. They may represent precipitation events, operational changes, and/or changes in pumping volumes. The fluid levels for the Secure Cell-LCS/LDS/PS for the third quarter 2020 are provided in Appendix B: on-Well Fluid Level Summary.

### GROUNDWATER LEVEL SUMMARY

A statistical groundwater level comparison has been completed for groundwater monitoring wells at the Site. The comparison is conducted by calculating the mean groundwater elevation of the historical data set for the well and then determining an upper bound and lower bound by adding or subtracting two (2) standard deviations. This analysis is shown on each monitoring well hydrograph presented in Appendix C: Hydrographs. Water levels for all but seven (7) monitoring wells were within the mean plus two standard deviations for all historical measurements during the fourth quarter 2020 monitoring period. The exceedances are summarized in Table 4: Groundwater Elevation Exceedances and each exceedance is described below.

L4-8N

The upper bound of 4847.36 feet above mean sea level was exceeded by 1.32 feet (the November 7, 2020 groundwater level was measured at 4848.68 feet above mean sea level). Hydrographs of the historical data show a regular increase in observed water levels at well L4-8N since measurements began around 1993. Therefore, while the increase is statistically significant according to the permit criteria, it is neither unexpected nor inconsistent with observed groundwater behavior at this location.

L4-9S

The upper bound of 4847.29 feet above mean sea level was exceeded by 2.14 feet (the November 6, 2020 groundwater level was measured at 4849.43 feet above mean sea level). Similar to other exceedances this quarter, hydrographs of the historical data show a regular increase in observed water levels at well L4-9S since measurements began around 1990\. Therefore, while the increase is statistically significant according to the permit criteria, it is neither unexpected nor inconsistent with observed groundwater behavior at this location.

L4-9W

The upper bound of 4847.55 feet above mean sea level was exceeded by 1.84 feet (the November 6, 2020 groundwater level was measured at 4849.39 feet above mean sea level). Similar to other exceedances this quarter, hydrographs of the historical data show a regular increase in observed water levels at well L4-9W since measurements began around 1989\. Therefore, while the increase is statistically significant according to the permit criteria, it is neither unexpected nor inconsistent with observed groundwater behavior at this location.

L4-9N

The upper bound of 4847.28 feet above mean sea level was exceeded by 1.46 feet (the November 6, 2020 groundwater level was measured at 4848.74 feet above mean sea level). Similar to other exceedances this quarter, hydrographs of the historical data show a regular increase in observed water levels at well L4-9S since measurements began around 1993\. Therefore, while the increase is statistically significant according to the permit criteria, it is neither unexpected nor inconsistent with observed groundwater behavior at this location.

L4-9

The upper bound of 4846.82 feet above mean sea level was exceeded by 0.47 feet (the November 6, 2020 groundwater level was measured at 4847.29 feet above mean sea level). Similar to other L4 monitoring wells, hydrographs of the historical data show a regular increase in observed water levels at well L4-9 since 1996. Therefore, while the increase is statistically significant according to the permit criteria, it is neither unexpected nor inconsistent with observed groundwater behavior at this location.

L4-17

The upper bound of 4839.83 feet above mean sea level was exceeded by 1.08 feet (the November 7, 2020 groundwater level was measured at 4840.91 feet above mean sea level). The hydrograph of the historical data show a regular increase in observed water levels at well L4-17 since around 2016. Therefore, while the increase is statistically significant according to the permit criteria, it is neither unexpected nor inconsistent with observed groundwater behavior at this location.

L4-39

The upper bound of 4823.37 feet above mean sea level was exceeded by 0.71 feet (the November 7, 2020 groundwater level was measured at 4824.08 feet above mean sea level). The hydrograph of the historical data show a regular increase in observed water levels at well L4-39 since around 2018. Therefore, while the increase is statistically significant according to the permit criteria, it is neither unexpected nor inconsistent with observed groundwater behavior at this location.

## DATA VALIDATION AND PROCEDURES

The second semi-annual 2020 Deer Trail water quality data review process included evaluation of Tier One field and laboratory quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) sample results. Evaluation criteria for the QA/QC review were based on facility Permit requirements, SW-846 Method requirements, and EPA data validation guidance.

A data validation checklist was previously prepared and submitted for approval in accordance with Permit Condition VII.C.2. The data validation procedures were developed to evaluate the data in terms of accuracy, precision, and completeness. An evaluation of data variability, possible data outliers, and potential data transfer or transcription errors, was also performed. The sections listed below detail the evaluation procedures and results of the data validation. Data validation summary tables such as Table G-1: Field Duplicate Evaluation Summary, Table G-2: Trip Blank and Equipment Evaluation Summary, and Table G-3: Data Validation Summary are found in Appendix G: Data Validation.

Collection of radiochemistry (RAD) samples during the first quarter 2020 sampling event marked the beginning of the twelfth year of quarterly sampling for RAD parameters. RAD data were collected for twelve months to establish background levels. The background sampling dataset was sufficient as of March 2006. The Facility accepted its first shipment of RAD waste in December 2006.

A reduced suite of RAD parameters as referenced in Table VII-3 of the Groundwater Sampling SOP began during third quarter 2008. The reduced suite includes Radium 226, Radium 228, Uranium (Total), Gross Alpha, and Gross Beta. Radium 226 and 228 analyses are performed on unfiltered (total) samples. Field filtered Uranium (Dissolved) was also collected during the second semi-annual event. During the fourth quarter of 2020, samples for RAD analysis were collected from thirty (30) locations, including six (6) leachate locations and twenty-four (24) monitoring wells.

### SAMPLE HOLDING TIME EVALUATION

All samples were evaluated in terms of sample receipt, preservation, sample custody, and holding times. All samples arrived at the laboratory properly chilled and in good condition. All samples were evaluated for correct transcription and tracking with no errors identified. Samples requiring extraction were extracted within appropriate holding times. A summary of this data is presented as Table G-3: Data Validation Summary, found within Appendix G.

### FIELD QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL DATA

Four blind field duplicate samples, four trip blanks, and two equipment blanks were submitted as field QA/QC samples during the second semi-annual 2020 sampling event. Results of the field quality assurance sampling are discussed in detail in the following sections.

### Field Duplicate (RPD) Analysis

Data validation was performed on all samples in accordance with Permit Condition VII.C.2. The data validation procedures were developed to evaluate the data in terms of accuracy, precision, and completeness. Field duplicate precision is determined by review of the field duplicate results. The field duplicate RPD criterion is 30 percent as specified in the Deer Trail GroundWater Sampling Plan. Analytical precision cannot be determined if the reported concentration is below the RL. Field duplicates are useful in documenting the combined field and laboratory precision and include two separate samples collected from the same source, at approximately the same time, stored in separate containers, and analyzed independently. The duplicate samples are collected and handled in a manner identical to the original sample.

The field duplicate samples were collected in support of the Waste Code F039, Table VII-3, PFOS/PFOA, and radiochemistry monitoring parameters. Sample DUP-1 was collected as a field duplicate of primary sample L5-5; DUP-2 was collected as a field duplicate of L4-8; DUP-3 was collected as a field duplicate of CELL4-LCS; DUP 3 was collected as a field duplicate of CELL4- LCS; DUP-4 was collected as a field duplicate of Cell4-LDS; and DUP-5 was collected as a field duplicate of CELL4-LCS. The Relative Percent Difference (RPDs) for the duplicate samples were less than 30 percent, (or radiochemistry statistical uncertainty increments), with the exceptions of forty-two (42) duplicate / primary sample pairs. The Duplicate Evaluation listing for all five (5) sample-duplicate pairs for all constituents is presented in Table G-1: Field Duplicate Evaluation Summary within Appendix G.

Forty-two (42) primary sample and duplicate pairs representing four (4) of the 5 duplicates and thirty-five (35) constituents are included in the list of exceptions. The constituents noted include organics (15), metals (9), PFOS/PFOA (6), radionuclides (3), general chemistry parameters (1), and Nitrate-Nitrite (1). The discrepancy in fifteen (15) of the samples is due to a comparison of a reported value against a non-detect, a J-value, or a U-value. J-Values Result is less than the Reporting Limit but greater than or equal to the Method Detection Limit and the concentration is an approximate value. U-values indicate a result that is less than the sample detection limit.

### Trip Blank Analysis

A trip blank is defined as a sample of analyte-free water prepared at the laboratory, shipped to the sampling site, and returned to the laboratory unopened for analysis (USEPA, 1990). The objective of a trip blank sample is to document potential contamination associated with sample shipping procedures, field and laboratory handling procedures, or other contamination associated with organic-free and deionized water provided by the laboratory. Trip blank samples are particularly useful in documenting volatile organic contamination from outside sources.

One trip blank was submitted to Test America in support of the second semi-annual (fourth quarter) 2020 sampling event. Sample “Trip Blank” was submitted for VOC analysis SW-846 8260B per the Permit Attachment 8 condition I.D. All results were non-detect. Laboratory results are provided in Table G-2: Trip Blank and Equipment Evaluation Summary found in Appendix G.

### Equipment and Field Blank Analysis

Three (3) equipment blanks were submitted for analysis for the full suite of methods and parameters listed in Table VII-3 in accordance with Section V.C. of the Permit Attachment 8: Ground Water Sampling Plan during the second semi-annual (fourth quarter) 2020 sampling event. There were nineteen (19) detections; all were inorganic with the exception of Gross Alpha. The inorganic constituents include Barium (Dissolved), Cadmium (Total), Chloride, Iron (Dissolved), Iron (Total), Mercury (Total), Sodium (Dissolved), Sodium (Total), Sulfide, Zinc (Dissolved) were detected. Laboratory results are provided in G-2: Trip Blank and Equipment Evaluation Summary found in Appendix G.

### Statistics for the Fourth Quarter 2020

Descriptive statistics and trend analysis were generated to characterize the analytical data collected for the 2020 fourth quarter sampling event and the results are presented in Appendix E: 2020 Second Semi-Annual Statistics. Appendix E-1: Summary Statistics presents the Descriptive Statistics. Appendix E-2: Trend Analysis Statistics presents the Trend Analysis, Appendix E-3: Concentration versus Time Plots presents the Concentration versus Time Plots for the monitoring wells, and Appendix E-4: Control Charts of Shewhart CUSUM Values presents the results of the control chart analysis. The statistical analyses completed are described below.

Descriptive statistics for the second semi-annual (fourth quarter) monitoring period, including the mean, median, maximum value, minimum value, standard deviation, variance, kurtosis, skewness coefficient, standard error, and coefficient of variance, were calculated for background, inorganic detection, organic detection, RAD, and general water quality parameters for each well and RAD for Secure Cell units. The results are presented as Table E-1: Second Semi-Annual 2020 Summary Statistics found within Appendix E. Any variations in the descriptive statistics appear to be associated with normal geochemical variability in the groundwater.

Trend analysis calculations for the second semi-annual (fourth quarter) monitoring period were calculated for background, inorganic detection, organic detection, and general water quality parameters for each well. Trend analyses are used to identify temporal changes in the data sets that may result from natural changes in the composition of the landfill cell fluids and groundwater. Trends were analyzed using Sen’s Trend and Mann Kendall Trend Analysis methods. These trends are used to determine the suitability of the current indication parameters in evaluating potential releases from the landfill cells. Trend analyses are only performed when ten or more sample points are available for the given parameter and location to obtain statistically significant results. The resulting analysis is presented as Appendix E-2: Trend Analysis Statistics found within Appendix E.

Concentration versus time plots were prepared for general water quality parameters, total organic halides, metals, cyanide, pesticides, herbicides, VOCs, SVOCs, and RAD for each well and Secure Cell units Cell1-LDS, Cell2-LDS, and TRB-LDS. Concentration versus time plots are presented in Appendix E-3: Concentration versus Time Plots. Concentration versus time plots present a visual representation of the analytical laboratory results for all historical data available for each leachate collection and monitoring well location. The trends observed are quantified by summary statistics and trend analysis.

The results of laboratory analysis for all metals listed in Table VII-3 collected from Secure Cell units Cell1-LDS, Cell2-LDS, and TRB-LDS and twenty-four (24) groundwater monitoring wells during the second semi-annual (fourth quarter) of 2020 were compared to their background datasets using both Shewhart Control Charts and CUSUM Control Charts. There were zero (0) analytes collected from Secure Cell leachate collection systems that failed the Shewhart / CUSUM Control Charts. No groundwater measurements exceeded the Shewhart Control Limits, indicating that concentrations of metals in the groundwater monitoring wells are consistent with the background dataset. The results of the analysis are provided in Appendix E-4: Control Charts of Shewhart CUSUM Values.

### RADIOCHEMISTRY DATA EVALUATION

## CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the groundwater protection monitoring data from the third quarter of 2020 do not present an indication of a verifiable waste release to groundwater from facility operations.

### FLUID LEVELS

The Cell1-LCS, Cell1-LDS, Cell2-LCS, Cell4-LCS, and Cell4-LDS fluid levels all remained relatively constant for the second semi-annual (fourth quarter) 2020 monitoring period. No definitive evidence of hydraulic communication between the LCS and the LDS or PS was indicated from the observed fluid levels. All of the water levels are within the anticipated range and are attributed to natural groundwater fluctuations. In summary, the groundwater protection monitoring data for the first and second semi-annual periods of 2020 do not present an indication of a verifiable waste release to groundwater from facility operations.

### ORGANIC DETECTIONS

There were forty-six (46) organic detections in the leachate samples collected from Secure Cell 1- LDS, Cell4-LCS/LDS, and TRB-LDS. Secure Cell1-LCS and Secure Cell2-LCS were not required to be sampled for organics during the fourth quarter. Twenty-three (23) volatile organic compounds; twelve (12) semi-volatile organic compounds; and eleven (11) herbicide and pesticide constituents were detected. PCB Aroclors were not detected in any leachate samples collected. There were three (3) organic detections above the RL in three (3) of the twenty-four (24) groundwater wells sampled. These constituents include Acetone, bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate, and Phenol. All three (3) constituents are common analytical laboratory contaminants. Table F-1: Summary of Accepted Laboratory Analysis Data presents the organic compounds detected in the leachate samples collected.

### INORGANIC DETECTIONS

There were sixty (60) inorganic detections in the leachate samples collected from Secure Cell 1- LDS, Cell4-LCS/LDS, and TRB-LDS. Secure Cell1-LCS and Secure Cell2-LCS were not required to be sampled for organics during the fourth quarter. There were two-hundred and eighty-four (284) inorganic detections in the twenty-four (24) groundwater monitoring wells sampled. There were no exceedances of the Shewhart / CUSUM limits for total metals as evidenced by Control Chart analysis.

### RADIOCHEMISTRY

The RAD samples collected during the fourth quarter of 2020 consisted of the RAD parameters as referenced in Table VII-3 of the Groundwater Sampling Plan: Gross Alpha, Gross Beta, field filtered Uranium (Dissolved), Uranium (Total), Radium 226, and Radium 228. Samples for RAD analysis were collected from thirty (30) locations including six (6) leachate and twenty-four (24) monitoring wells. Concentrations in leachate and groundwater samples collected during the third quarter of 2020 are within the natural variation observed in past monitoring events.
